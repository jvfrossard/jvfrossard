## JoÃ£o Vitor Frossard ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! I'm JoÃ£o, Software Development Manager at Brasil TecPar Inc. Be welcome to my personal Github Page!

## ðŸ‘· About me

I'm a physicist in an eternal honeymoon with technology and software development. I currently work at Brasil TecPar Inc., one of the top 5 telecommunications companies in Brazil, as a Software Development Manager. I lead both product and technical point of views, overseeing teams and software solutions across almost all fields of the company.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies

Languages: Python, SQL, JavaScript, PHP
Frameworks: Django, Flask, NextJS, ReactJS, Celery
Databases: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
DataViz: Tableau
DevOps: Docker, Jenkins

## ðŸ“Š Personal projects

My most important work right now is an open-source DataOps framework designed to help Python developers, data analysts, and other data professionals handle data workflows with easeâ€”avoiding the complexity of Apache Airflow while offering more power than standard tools like DBT. The framework is heavily based on Flask, and I plan to release it to the community soon.
